#Drive Safe for Glass#

## About ##
*Drive Safe* is a new piece of Glassware coming to Google Glass, aimed at making Glass a tool to be used for helping people drive safer.

*Drive Safe* uses the eye sensor and the accelerometer to determine if you're falling asleep. If so, an alert is played and with one tap, you can get directions to a rest area.

More features coming soon!
